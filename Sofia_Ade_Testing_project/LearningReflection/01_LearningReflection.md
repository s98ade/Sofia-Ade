> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- instructions were straight forward and clear
- it was interesting to see how detailed you can be when testing an application
- the assignment project was an interesting introduction to Robot Framework  

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I read and watched more about the use of the Robot Framework
- after getting familiar with the terminology and workflow, I started to get familiar with the test object
- after reading the instructions I started writing the possible test cases, adding steps after each other
- with each step in the test case I added the needed variables
- at the end I added the documentation and settings
    
## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I am unfortunately not acquinted with other test management tools

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- VSCode
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I did not encounter any trouble, but when I was unsure about something I returned to the GitHub page "How to write good test cases"

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have been using Github for a year now to present my projects and colaborate on other projects with different people
- so far I know the basic use of Github and haven't encountered any trouble with it

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- it depends on the situation: if my main task would be developing an application I would use "unittest" or "pytest" libraries to perform unit tests (I mainly work with python)
- for bigger test cases I would use the Robot Framework and the SeleniumLibrary

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Regression testing
- Test planning
- Bug-Tracking
- Programming
- Selenium WebDriver
- Jira

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I need practical experience in software testing: using the technical tools but also execute what we have learned in this course practically

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think this course was a nice compact introduction to software testing and the use of the Robot Framework
- I personally would add a project where we actually have to plan a testing cycle instead of using the Robot Framework (if I am not wrong there is another course which will cover Robot Framework) -> this would deepen our theoretical knowledge
